challenged, I will be able to prove that what I write or say is
true,
Always treat all people with respect. I will never use
information to cause harm or appear to cause harm to any
person or group of people, and
Respect and protect information tools and that I will neither
do any harm to a computer system, network, software, or
other person's information; nor will I allow others to do harm
to a computer system, network, software, or other person's
information.
