Dear John,
In 2000, with an invitation from Tree Press Editor Brian Dorn, The Poetic Society agreed to
sponsor the New Light Prize in Poetry for a First Book. As chairman of the Poetic Society, I
consented with pleasure to serve as final judge for the contest - an annual award to recognize and
publish a poet's first collection. The plans for the press were ambitious: The Book Review would
sponsor a book prize to be given to any poet, previously published or not; Blue Sky would sponsor
a criticism prize; and Tree Press would publish other books of drama, fiction, and poetry.
I am proud of the books selected for the New Light Prize-books by Greg Best, Lilly Black, Rose
Red, and most recently Fred White. The books have been handsome, widely reviewed, and well
received.
Or three of them have been. Lilly Black was awarded the 2004 prize, but her book has yet to
appear. I wrote an introduction to Joyful Day - her brilliant, darkly adventurous book of lyrics -

Dear
John,
In
2000,
with
an
invitation
from
Tree
Press
Editor
Brian
Dorn,
The
Poetic
Society
agreed
to
sponsor
the
New
Light
Prize
in
Poetry
for
a
First
Book.
As
chairman
of
the
Poetic
Society,
I
consented
with
pleasure
to
serve
as
final
judge
for
the
contest
-
an
annual
award
to
recognize
and
publish
a
poet's
first
collection.
The
plans
for
the
press
were
ambitious:
The
Book
Review
would
sponsor
a
book
prize
to
be
given
to
any
poet,
previously
published
or
not;
Blue
Sky
would
sponsor
a
criticism
prize;
and
Tree
Press
would
publish
other
books
of
drama,
fiction,
and
poetry.
I
am
proud
of
the
books
selected
for
the
New
Light
Prize-books
by
Greg
Best,
Lilly
Black,
Rose
Red,
and
most
recently
Fred
White.
The
books
have
been
handsome,
widely
reviewed,
and
well
received.
Or
three
of
them
have
been.
Lilly
Black
was
awarded
the
2004
prize,
but
her
book
has
yet
to
appear.
I
wrote
an
introduction
to
Joyful
Day
-
her
brilliant,
darkly
adventurous
book
of
lyrics
