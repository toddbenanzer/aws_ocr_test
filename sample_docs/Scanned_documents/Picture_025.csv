98.1318588256836,Dear Mr. White:
99.84874725341797,"This is a request for an investigation of companies that conduct so-called ""free marketing,'"
99.87850952148438,"which is a technique by which corporations seek to influence buying decisions, often by stealth."
99.82292175292969,There is evidence that some of these companies are perpetrating large-scale deception upon
99.89839172363281,consumers by deploying free marketers who fail to disclose that they have been enlisted to
99.8989486694336,promote products.
99.90543365478516,This failure to disclose is fundamentally fraudulent and misleading; and it might violate
99.93487548828125,prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts and practices affecting commerce. An investigation
99.90886688232422,by
99.8260498046875,"the Commission could lead to actions against individual free marketers,"
99.79845428466797,and/or to new guidelines requiring disclosure by any and all persons who are paid to engage in
99.87149047851562,free marketing operations.
99.7918701171875,"Fraud is fraud, and a harmless-sounding name such as ""free marketing"" doesn't change that."
99.875244140625,"Sincerely,"
