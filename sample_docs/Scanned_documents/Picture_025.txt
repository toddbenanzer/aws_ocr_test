Dear Mr. White:
This is a request for an investigation of companies that conduct so-called "free marketing,'
which is a technique by which corporations seek to influence buying decisions, often by stealth.
There is evidence that some of these companies are perpetrating large-scale deception upon
consumers by deploying free marketers who fail to disclose that they have been enlisted to
promote products.
This failure to disclose is fundamentally fraudulent and misleading; and it might violate
prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts and practices affecting commerce. An investigation
by
the Commission could lead to actions against individual free marketers,
and/or to new guidelines requiring disclosure by any and all persons who are paid to engage in
free marketing operations.
Fraud is fraud, and a harmless-sounding name such as "free marketing" doesn't change that.
Sincerely,
Fred Vert,
Executive Director

Dear
Mr.

This

conduct
so-called

which
is
a

by
which

There
is
evidence
that
some
of
these
companies
are
perpetrating
large-scale
deception
upon
consumers
by
deploying
free
marketers
who
fail
to

that
they

This
failure
to

is
fundamentally
fraudulent
and
misleading;
and
it
might
violate

An

Fraud
is

doesn't
change
that.
