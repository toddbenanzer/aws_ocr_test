In 1929 Gustav Tauschek obtained a patent on OCR in Germany, followed by Handel
who obtained a US patent on OCR in USA in 1933 (U.S. Patent 1,915,993). In 1935
Tauschek was also granted a US patent on his method (U.S. Patent 2,026,329)
Tauschek's machine was a mechanical device that used templates and a photodetector.
In 1950, David H. Shepard, a cryptanalyst at the Armed Forces Security Agency in the
United States, addressed the problem of converting printed messages into machine
language for computer processing and built a machine to do this, reported in the
Washington Daily News on 27 Apri 1951 and in the New York Times on 26 December

1953 after his U.S. Patent 2,663,758 was issued. Shepard then founded Intelligent
OCR systems used in commercial operation.
The system first was commercial sold to the system Standard was Oil installed Company at the for Reader's reading credit Digest card in 1955. imprints The for second billing
purposes. Other systems sold by IMR during the late 1950s included a bil stub reader
to
the Ohio Bell Telephone Company and a page scanner to the United States Air Force
for reading and transmitting by teletype typewritten messages. IBM and others were
later licensed on Shepard's OCR patents.

In about 1965 Reader's Digest and RCA collaborated to build an OCR Document reader
designed to digitise the serial numbers on Reader's Digest coupons returned from
advertisements. The font used on the documents were printed by an RCA Drum printer
using the OCR-A font. The reader was connected directly to an RCA 301 computer (one
of the first solid state computers). This reader was followed by a specialised document

The United States Postal Service has been using OCR machines to sort mail since
1965 based on technology devised primarily by the prolific inventor Jacob Rabinow. The
first use of OCR in Europe was by the British General Post Office (GPO). In 1965 it
began planning an entire banking system, the National Giro, using OCR technology,
a
process that revolutionized bill payment systems in the UK. Canada Post has been
using OCR systems since 1971[citation needed]. OCR systems read the name and
address of the addressee at the first mechanised sorting center, and print a routing bar
code on the envelope based on the postal code. To avoid confusion with the human-
readable address field which can be located anywhere on the letter, special ink (orange
in visible light) is used that is clearly visible under ultraviolet light Envelopes may then
be processed with equipment based on simple barcode readers.
